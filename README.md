# Parser
This small project focuses on four essential Swift types: String, Array, Dictionary and Tuple.

I created a parser that

• Reads in data from a file into a Swift String

• Parses the String into an Array containing its component words

• Uses a Dictionary to calculate how often each word occurs

• Use a combination of Dictionary, Tuple, and Array instances to sort the words by how frequently they occur
